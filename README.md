# 📊 Student Performance Analysis

This project analyzes a dataset of student performance using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. It explores how various factors such as gender, ethnicity, parental education, lunch type, and weekly study hours impact academic performance in math, reading, and writing.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is `Expanded_data_with_more_features.csv`, which includes the following features:

- Gender
- Ethnic Group
- Parental Education
- Lunch Type
- Test Preparation
- Weekly Study Hours
- Math Score
- Reading Score
- Writing Score
- Practice of Sports
- Transport Means
- Number of Siblings

## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset
- Visualize distributions and group comparisons
- Understand how socio-economic and personal factors influence academic scores

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python 3
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📌 Highlights
